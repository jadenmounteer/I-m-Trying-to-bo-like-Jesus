# I-m-Trying-to-be-like-Jesus
I'm Trying to be like Jesus is a program I am currently working on that aids the user in developing Christlike attributes. The user is taken through 
a virtual version of the Christlike attributes activity found in Preach My Gospel and is then given the results. This program is made using Python 3.
To use the program, download the file and run the main.py file.
